## **Tim Castillo-Gill**

I am a life-time learner, motivated by curiosity and questioning; a junior software engineer with a strong interest in technology for sustainable outcomes. 

I have performed viola with loop pedal in a range of situations, from performances to the upper echelons of Qatar to street performing (busking) in my home town of Stroud. Graduating with a music degree, and later a PGCE (teaching qualification) from Exeter University, I have been a teacher to primary school children for five years. 

I am now looking for a role in an organisation that offers opportunities to deepen my knowledge while working at the highest possible standard.

## **Experience**

****[Lanesborough Prep School](https://www.lanesborough.surrey.sch.uk/)**** (January 2019 to August 2020)
**Teacher of Year 4 & Year 6**

* Breaking down processes for understanding and learning
* Invoking motivation through children’s interests (e.g. explore friction through designing a pair of trainers)
* Short term planning (single lesson) to long term planning (termly). Thinking about the broad objectives of the term, breaking them down into the smaller objectives of the weeks, breaking them down to the daily objectives of the lesson. Skills, methods and understanding.

****[British Junior Academy of Brussels](https://bjab.org/)**** (September 2015 to August 2018)
**Year 3 teacher and Music and Performing Arts Coordinator**

* Developed acute time-management skills in order to fulfil my two responsibilities
* Had a lead role in organising the school carol concert, musically and logistically; one musical play performance per term from certain year groups; and the end of year school song. Object-orientated goals. 

## **Skills**

#### **Discipline**

To thrive at either teaching or professional musicianship, discipline and focus are non-negotiable to stay afloat and stay smiling. Throughout my careers I have put systems in place like time-blocking, bounteous todo listing and self-awareness of ensuring ‘left-brain’ activities for one day and ‘right-brain’ for another. 

In order to become a professional musician and then teacher, I’ve had to be disciplined and focused, using time-blocks in order to better productivity.

#### **Creative problem-solving**
What’s the objective? What is needed to do it? 

By breaking down a learning objective into small chunks and then dissecting  for necessary knowledge, methods or strategies for each chunk, I found my teaching foundations. I could then creatively problem-solve using teaching and learning behaviours and strategies to unlock the necessary chunks for young learners. Throughout my time at Makers, I found this strategy of creative problem-solving an excellent tool or process in order to unlock the difficulties, bugs or problem areas that inevitably arise in code.

~~In teaching, taking this methodical approach to lesson planning helped me streamline a transferable process that yielded good results. Asking: What skills, methods, understanding do they need in order to reach that objective? By planning a lesson in reverse, while incorporating learning strategies, problem solving and creating visual aids.~~ 

~~On a day-to-day basis and sometimes at short notice I was implementing a range of problem-solving strategies.~~ 

#### **Reflective and Critical Thinking**
An effective teacher is reflective and honest about the ‘what went well’ and the ‘even better if’ aspects of their teaching. This reflective practise facilitates self-development and best practice. 

To inform teaching objectives,  it is necessary to evaluate and interpret  test results. I have used this information to inform teaching objectives, assess performance, evaluate and monitor the progress of children. Makers emphasises a Test-driven development technique, similar to my experience in education, we can use this to find gaps in knowledge, or in code, misaligned method arguments for example.

#### **Time management**
Several times a day, five days a week, a classful of children act out the message, “coming, ready or not”. Ensuring preparation of resources, timetable management, messages from parents and senior management are adhered to, marking, toilet time, coats on time and swimming costumes are taken home at the end of the day. The list is exhaustive of how imperative time management and organisation skills are in primary education.
