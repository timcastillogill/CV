## Tim Castillo-Gill


A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what excites you about tech.

I am a life-time learner, motivated by curiosity and questioning; a junior software engineer with a strong interest in technology for sustainable outcomes. 

I have performed viola with loop pedal in a range of situations, from performances to the upper echelons of Qatar to street performing (busking) in my home town of Stroud. Graduating with a music degree, and later a PGCE (teaching qualification) from Exeter University, I have been a teacher to primary school children for five years. ~~Breaking down processes for understanding and learning~~ has been my life for the last five years, and I now use those skills everyday in software development.

## Experience
**Lanesborough Prep School** (January 2019 to August 2020)
*Teacher of Year 4 & Year 6*

* Breaking down processes for understanding and learning
* Invoking motivation through children’s interests (e.g. explore friction through designing a pair of trainers)
* Short term planning (single lesson) to long term planning (termly). Thinking about the broad objectives of the term, breaking them down into the smaller objectives of the weeks, breaking them down to the daily objectives of the lesson. Skills, methods and understanding.

**British Junior Academy of Brussels** (September 2015 to August 2018)
*Year 3 teacher and Music and Performing Arts Coordinator*

* Developed acute time-management skills in order to fulfil my two responsibilities
* Had a lead role in organising the school carol concert, musically and logistically; one musical play performance per term from certain year groups; and the end of year school song. Object-orientated goals. 



## Skills
Consider skills relevant to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

* Team work & Communicating complex procedures systematically for clear workflow understanding
* Detail orientated: What’s the objective? Fine-tune and refactor for a more streamlined process. Designing curricula, incorporating learning strategies, problem solving, creating visual aids. 

* Assigning grades: Evaluating, examining, assessing performance, interpreting test results, determining potential of individuals, monitoring progress. 
* Working under pressure and meeting deadlines: Several times a day, five days a week, thirty-six weeks a year, a classful of students act out the message, “coming, ready or not,” having the ability to step to the front of the classroom to carry out lesson plans. And having a contingency plan for backup, just in case the AV equipment is not delivered on time. 

#### Discipline
In order to become a professional musician and then teacher, I have had to be disciplined and focused, using time-blocks in order to better productivity.

#### Creative problem-solving
What’s the objective? What do they need to do it? 

In teaching, taking this methodical approach to lesson planning helped me streamline a transferable process that yielded good results. Asking: What skills, methods, understanding do they need in order to reach that objective? Planning in reverse while incorporating learning strategies, problem solving and creating visual aids. 

On a day-to-day basis and sometimes at short notice I was implementing a range of problem-solving strategies. 

#### Reflective and Critical Thinking
An effective teacher is reflective and honest about the ‘what went well’ and the ‘even better if’ aspects of their teaching. This reflective practise facilitates self-development and best practice. 

To inform teaching objectives,  it is necessary to evaluate and interpret  test results. 
Evaluating and interpreting test results to inform teaching objectives, assess performance, evaluate and monitor progress of children is a very important aspect of teaching, particularly while the current test driven philosophy of education exists. 

#### Time management
Several times a day, five days a week, a classful of children act out the message, “coming, ready or not”. Ensuring preparation of resources, timetable management, messages from parents and senior management are adhered to, marking, toilet time, coats on time and swimming costumes are taken home at the end of the day. The list is exhaustive of how imperative time management skills are in primary education. 

## Education

#### Makers Academy (September 2020 to December 2020)
Highly selective 12 week intensive coding bootcamp.

* Focus on Test Driven Development, emphasising pair programming and agile workflow
* 
* OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
* Agile/XP
* Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
* RSpec, Jasmine

#### Exeter University (2014 to 2015)

* PGCE Primary with specialism in music education

#### Oxford Brookes (2006 to 2009)

* BA in Music: 2:2

#### Any other qualifications
That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies
* **Music**: Actively follow a diverse range of music.
* **Composition**: Compose and perform using viola and live sampling/looping (www.TimGillViola.com). 
* **Psychology**: Read and research psychological interests including mindfulness and education psychology.

Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team
