My background is in education, as a primary school teacher I taught a large range of subjects. Increasingly, I used technology in the classroom from using google maps in Geography, writing questionnaires in topic subjects, sending assignments through [Google Classroom](https://edu.google.com/intl/en-GB/products/classroom/) and [Showbie](https://www.showbie.com/), creating mood boards in [Padlet](https://en-gb.padlet.com/) and programming using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), [Lightbot](https://lightbot.com/) and [LegoMindstorm](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/categories/coding-for-kids). 

I have spent much of my career learning and developing skills across a range of fields with amazing people. Now I am embarking on a new challenge as a software developer, where I can pool all of my knowledge and experience to help build fantastic products. 

I have just completed a software engineering course at Makers Academy, where I was able to develop skills and processes in line with best industry practices. I feel motivated to produce clean, test-driven code to create products that make a difference.

## Other Skills

### What's the **objective**?

I am experienced in breaking down a problem into manageable chunks and taking a methodical approach as is necessary in education. Lesson planning helped me streamline a transferable process that yielded great results. Asking: What skills, methods, understanding are necessary in order to reach that objective? Working from the destination, backwards.

### Working under pressure and meeting deadlines

Several times a day, five days a week, a class full of students act out the message, “coming, ready or not,” having the ability to step to the front of the classroom to carry out lesson plans. And having a contingency plan for backup, just in case the computer fails you!

### Discipline

In order to become a professional musician, I have had to be disciplined and focused, using systematic approaches in order to learn and practise efficiently. I use time-blocks in order to better productivity.

### Reflective and Critical Thinking

An effective teacher is reflective and honest about the ‘what went well’ and the ‘even better if’ aspects of their teaching. This reflective practise facilitates self-development and best practice.
