## Background

I am a recent graduate of one of the most prestigious dev bootcamps in the world, [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). I'm now ready to hone my skills by joining an ambitious and driven team.

As a result of my training I am now familiar with best practices in software development:
- Agile methodologies
- Test Driven Development
- Git
- Modelling

In a previous life, I was a primary school teacher which has tooled me with transferable skills in communication and knowledge sharing. Whether that be during paired-programming sessions or presenting a product to a client.

Using electronic resources to teach children opened my eyes to the potential tech products have to impact our world for good. While Edutech remains a strong interest, I also know that technology is going to be a big player in slowing climate change through sustainable energies. I want to be a part of building the solution, which is why I've decided to become a software engineer.

## Soft Skills

---

### Creative Problem Solver - What's the **objective**?

I am experienced in breaking down a problem into manageable chunks and taking a methodical approach. Lesson planning helped me streamline processes that yield results.

### Efficient and Flexible - Can you **time block** and adapt?

A simulated experience during Makers when our 'client' required a switch of language implementation midway through the project. Implementing important agile methodologies and critical time blocking helped us reorganise and redistribute the necessary tasks.

### Discipline - 10,000 hours and counting

In order to become a professional musician, I have had to be disciplined and focused. I used systematic approaches in order to learn and practise efficiently and time blocks in order to better productivity.

### Reflective and Critical Thinking - What do you know now, that you didn't know this morning?

Throughout teaching and learning I have used the feedback loop to my advantage, providing a fantastic door to unknown perspectives and reflections with which to learn and develop from. My technical process has developed greatly throughout this course due to consistent practise and feedback.
